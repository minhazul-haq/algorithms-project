CSE 5311: Design and Analysis of Algorithms

The project computes the running times of Minumum Spanning Tree algorithms for sparse graphs and dense graphs seperately. Three different versions of the algorithms have been implemented:  
1. Prim's algorithms using adjacency list  
2. Prim's algorithms using adjacency matrix  
3. Kruskal's algorithm  
  
  
How to run the project:  
1. Compile and run graph_generator.cpp to generate data files  
2. Open, build and run "MST comparision" project using NetBeans  
3. If you want to change graph type and number of vertices, modify "graphType" and "totalVertices" in MSTComparision.java
